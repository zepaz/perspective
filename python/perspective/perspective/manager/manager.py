    """PerspectiveManager is an orchestrator for running Perspective on the
    server side.

    The core functionality resides in `process()`, which receives
    JSON-serialized messages from a client (implemented by `perspective-viewer`
    in the browser), executes the commands in the message, and returns the
    results of those commands back to the `post_callback`. Table instances
    should be passed to the manager using `host_table` - this allows server
    code to call Table APIs natively instead of proxying them through the
    Manager. Because Perspective is designed to be used in a shared context,
    i.e. multiple clients all accessing the same `Table`, PerspectiveManager
    comes with the context of `sessions` - an encapsulation of the actions
    and resources used by a single connection to Perspective, which can be
    cleaned up after the connection is closed.

    - When a client connects, for example through a websocket, a new session
        should be spawned using `new_session()`.
    - When the websocket closes, call `close()` on the session instance to
        clean up associated resources.
